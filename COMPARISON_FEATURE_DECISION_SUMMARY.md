## 🚦 Risk Assessment

### Option A (Full System)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Migration fails | Low | High | Extensive testing, rollback plan |
| Scan times too slow | High | High | Make async, or abandon AI detection |
| AI costs spike | Medium | Medium | Make opt-in, monitor usage |
| Users don't use it | Low | High | Validate with beta first |
| Database performance | Medium | Medium | Careful indexing, monitoring |

**Overall Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH

### Option B (Lightweight)
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Migration fails | Very Low | Low | Simple additive changes |
| Performance issues | Very Low | Low | Minimal processing added |
| Users want more | Medium | Low | Can upgrade to Option A later |
| False positive comparisons | Low | Low | Use conservative matching |

**Overall Risk:** 🟢 LOW

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Phased Implementation

### **Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)**
**What:** Add domain linking, no comparison yet
**Risk:** 🟢 Minimal
**User Impact:** None (invisible infrastructure)
**Go/No-Go Decision Point:** After testing

### **Phase 2: Basic Comparison (2 weeks)**
**What:** Implement Option B (lightweight)
**Risk:** 🟢 Low
**User Impact:** New comparison view
**Go/No-Go Decision Point:** After beta testing with 10 users

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Tracking (4-6 weeks)** ⬅️ *Only if Phase 2 validates demand*
**What:** Add recommendation-level history
**Risk:** 🟡 Medium
**User Impact:** Per-recommendation tracking
**Go/No-Go Decision Point:** Based on Phase 2 usage metrics

### **Phase 4: AI Detection (3-4 weeks)** ⬅️ *Optional Pro feature*
**What:** Add AI-powered implementation detection
**Risk:** 🟡 Medium
**User Impact:** Auto-detect completed work
**Go/No-Go Decision Point:** Based on willingness to pay

## ✅ Decision Framework

### Choose **Option A (Full System)** if:
- ✓ You have 3 months of dev time available
- ✓ You're willing to invest $16k-32k upfront
- ✓ You can absorb $50-150/month ongoing costs
- ✓ Advanced tracking is core differentiator for your product
- ✓ You have validation that users will pay premium for this
- ✓ You're confident in technical team's ability to execute complex migration

### Choose **Option B (Lightweight)** if:
- ✓ You want to validate demand first
- ✓ You need to ship quickly (2-4 weeks)
- ✓ You want minimal risk to existing users
- ✓ You have limited dev resources right now
- ✓ You want to avoid ongoing AI costs
- ✓ Basic comparison is sufficient for MVP

### Choose **Wait / Don't Build** if:
- ✓ You have higher priority features
- ✓ Users haven't asked for this
- ✓ Current scan history is meeting needs
- ✓ Development resources are constrained
- ✓ You're focused on customer acquisition, not retention

## 📋 Questions to Answer Before Proceeding

1. **How often do users scan the same domain?**
   - If rarely → Lower value, maybe not worth it
   - If frequently → High value, users will use it

2. **Do users currently ask about "what changed" or "did I already get this rec"?**
   - Check support tickets / feedback
   - Validates actual demand

3. **What's your current monthly scan volume?**
   - Affects cost calculations for Option A
   - Low volume → Option A too expensive
   - High volume → Option A costs justified

4. **What's your churn rate and why are users leaving?**
   - If not seeing progress → This feature helps
   - If cost → This feature won't help

5. **Do you have 2-3 weeks of dev time available?**
   - If yes → Option B is feasible
   - If no → Wait until you do

6. **Would "Track Progress" be a good Pro-tier exclusive feature?**
   - Could drive upgrades from DIY → Pro
   - Or make free to reduce churn across all tiers?

## 💡 Final Recommendation

**Start with Option B (Lightweight Version)**

**Why:**
- ✅ Quick to validate (2-4 weeks)
- ✅ Low risk to paying customers
- ✅ No ongoing costs
- ✅ Foundation for Option A later if needed
- ✅ Positive ROI in 3-6 months
- ✅ Users get value immediately

**Then:**
- Monitor usage for 2-3 months
- If >50% of users use comparison feature → Invest in Option A
- If <20% use it → Feature wasn't needed, saved 6-8 weeks of work
- If 20-50% use it → Keep as-is, iterate based on feedback

**Bottom Line:**
Start small, validate demand, scale up if users love it. Don't over-engineer before proving value.
